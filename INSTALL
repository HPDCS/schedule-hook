schedule-hook Installation Instructions
***************************************


Prerequisites
=============

This software contains a Linux kernel module and a shared library.
Therefore this should be a reasonable list of prerequisites:

- Linux Kernel, version >= 2.6.26
- Linux Kernel headers
- gcc C compiler
- System map and configuration for the current kernel version installed
  in /boot/
- udev to set correct permissions on the created device file, looking
  for new rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/

  
Basic Installation
==================

   To generate configuration and installation scripts, run `./autogen.sh'
   To install the schedule-hook kernel module the
shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should do all the jobs.
When running make install, this should be done with administrator privileges
to install the kernel module in the extra/ modules' tree.
`modprobe -a` is run as well at the end of make install, so the module
is made visible to the system.

Please note that during the execution of ./configure, the kernel map is
inspected looking for symbols. Therefore, if the kernel is changed, ./configure
should be run again. Running only `make` could generate a module which is
incorrect.
